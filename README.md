# Base utilities are still under development.

## All the AX Project`s utilities and applications as well as the driver itself rely on the base library below.

### Default AX method shared library:
```ax_utility.lib``` 
### It`s corresponding header: 
```ax_utility.h``` 
### located in: 
```ax_virt_layer_utils/utils/base/build/```
### Each standard utility provides it`s own API that allows for easy scalability although all of them rely on the same core principals and naming conventions.
